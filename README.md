## Features ðŸ•¹
--------------
- 100% Kotlin-only
- Following MVVM Architectural Design Pattern
- Dark theme
- Multi-Languages
- [Architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/architecture) - Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
- [Lifecycles](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/lifecycle) - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
- [Repository](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide#fetch-data) - Repository modules handle data operations.
- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/state#viewmodel-state) - Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
- [coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines#:~:text=A%20coroutine%20is%20a%20concurrency,established%20concepts%20from%20other%20languages.) A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
- [flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) Flows are built on top of coroutines and can provide multiple values. A flow is conceptually a stream of data that can be computed asynchronously. 
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - A basic unit of composable UI.
- [Navigation Compose]( https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation) The Navigation component provides support for Jetpack Compose applications. You can navigate between composables while taking advantage of the Navigation componentâ€™s infrastructure and features.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for turns your HTTP API into a Java interface
- [Dagger-Hilt](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/libraries#hilt) Hilt is the recommended solution for dependency injection in Android apps, and works seamlessly with Compose.
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
- [Datastore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore) Jetpack DataStore is a data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers. DataStore uses Kotlin coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally.
